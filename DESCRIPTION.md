# Hyper Download Manager

Hyper Download Manager (HDM) is designed to be a superior, modern alternative to legacy download managers. 

## Key Highlights
- **Native Look & Feel**: Uses `Segoe UI` and standard Windows controls to blend seamlessly with the OS.
- **High Performance**: Utilization of `requests` and `QThread` for efficient, non-blocking downloads.
- **User-Centric Design**: Minimalist interface with no clutter.
